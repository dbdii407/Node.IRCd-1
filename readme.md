Disclaimer
----------

Node.IRCd is an experimental project. As such, I would highly advise that you
do not use this IRCd in production. There's no reason it shouldn't work, but I
probably won't offer support in a production setting.

Please keep this disclaimer in mind if you choose to file a bug report.

Introduction
------------

Node.IRCd is a work in progress, RFC1459 compliant IRCd written in node.js.
Linking to other servers is not supported at this time, although it will be in
the future.

Refer to the configuration file `nodeircd.json` for configuration options. Once
you're done, simply execute the `nodeircd.js` file.

Node.IRCd conforms to the ECMAScript 2020 specification.
