Welcome to Node.IRCd. The text you see here (the "Message of the Day", or MOTD
for short) is read from a file named "motd.txt" in the "config" folder where if
you are the server owner should have hopefully modified the main configuration
file (`nodeircd.json`).

An MOTD (Message of the Day) is optional. If you are the server owner and you
do not want an MOTD, you may either:

(a) remove this file
(b) remove the `MOTDFile` entry in the main configuration file

If you're seeing this on a production server, I'm sorry.
